Project Status
 **Ongoing Learning & Simulation Project**

This SOC lab is an ongoing hands-on learning project.  
I am actively performing additional attack simulations against the Ubuntu endpoint and analyzing the resulting logs in Splunk to understand detection patterns, attacker behavior, and SIEM alerting.

New scenarios will be added as I continue testing, learning, and documenting real-world attack techniques and their corresponding detections.
