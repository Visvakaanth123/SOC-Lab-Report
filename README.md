This repository contains a SOC lab simulation designed to demonstrate detection and monitoring of a full attack lifecycle in a controlled environment. The lab includes:

Ubuntu VM (target)

Kali Linux VM (attacker)

Splunk Enterprise (log aggregation and alerting)

The project simulates real-world attack scenarios such as port scanning, SSH brute force, data staging, and data exfiltration. Alerts and logs are collected to showcase how a SOC team detects and responds to malicious activity.
